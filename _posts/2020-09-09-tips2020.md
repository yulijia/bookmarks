[Dr. Eiichiro Komatsu](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~komatsu/) gave a talk about faculty, grant, and fellowship applications.

I like the slides short name "tips2020". It is true that the academy job application procedure may change a lot from the last century to now. It may keep change in the future.
