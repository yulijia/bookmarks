>ThreatConnect®, in partnership with Defense Group Inc., has uncovered intelligence linking malicious malware and spear phishing attacks launched by the “Naikon” Advanced Persistent Threat group to a specific unit of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.


This company demonstrated that one of Chinese in PLA is an hacker and do spear phishing attacks under the PLA's command. Although the evidences is not strong to say that <code>GXXXX</code> is the real person live in YunNan, 5 years work on this project seems enough to make a conclusion as above.

For me, I think we should not leak a lot of personal information online. **We are being watched.**

A Chinese version of this report is at [here](http://drops.wooyun.org/papers/9435).
