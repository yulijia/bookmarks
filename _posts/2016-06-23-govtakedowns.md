GitHub receives requests from governments to remove content that has been declared unlawful in their local jurisdiction.

I know it from the [Cyber Security Association of China sent github a mail to delete something in Github (in Chinese)](http://www.solidot.org/story?sid=48685)

I think the [post](https://github.com/programthink/zhao/issues/38) is a rumor. Github is not a place for politics.
